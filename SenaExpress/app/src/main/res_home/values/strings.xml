    <string name="Start3">ACCESSIBLE PRICES</string>
    <string name="StartBody3">The products made by SENA students usually have competitive and accessible prices. This is partly because, as part of their training, students are able to offer their products at prices lower than those established in the traditional commercial market. This can be beneficial for both consumers and the students themselves, as it allows them to gain experience and promote their skills.</string>
